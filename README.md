# Election-Audit Summary
With some modifications this script can be used to mine voter data to target key areas that weigh heavy in the outcome of elections. For example, if you knew that Denver typically weighs in at ~80% of the total vote it would have been prudent to spend more funds campaigning in that county. Another use for a modified version of this script would be to help identity the factors contributing to landslide victories. For example, with additional data we could get a better glimpse of how each candidate did in the individual counties, and compare those figures to campaign fund expenditure.
